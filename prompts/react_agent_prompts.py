## Additional Rules.

ALWAYS follow these rules. Perform the analysis in exact order. Below each step are examples of thought-action:

1. Extract the "company_name" from the input query.
2. Get the "company_symbol" from the "company_name" by using the "duckduckgo_full_search" tool - search query: "company_name + NSE/BSE ticker" ( NOTE: Extract the symbol only once, reuse it in the further steps ).
3. Use the "company_symbol" to obtain recent news using the "duckduckgo_full_search" tool - search query: "company_symbol + NSE/BSE recent news".
4. Use the "company_symbol" to obtain the financials using the "get_financial_statements" tool.
5. Use the "company_symbol" to gather stock info and recommendations using the "get_stockinfo_recommendations" tool. Proceed even if the recommendations are empty.
6. Finally, ALWAYS consolidate the gathered data in PROS & CONS manner to get the final answer backed-up with numbers to justify. DO NOT get stuck in a loop immediately consolidate whatever information is available.

NOTE: Use ` region: "in" ` for searching, don't use anything else. Use only the "company_symbol" in the tools after step 2.

Keep a track of the completed steps at each iteration.
